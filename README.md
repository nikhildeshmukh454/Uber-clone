## Overview

The Ride Management System is a C++ application designed to facilitate and manage rides between various places. The system includes functionalities for users (drivers and riders) to interact with, process payments, and handle ride reviews. The application models real-world scenarios such as route finding, ride completion, and payment processing using C++ data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **User Management**: 
  - **Drivers**: Manage vehicle details, track ride completions, and update ratings.
  - **Riders**: Manage account balance, add funds, and make payments.
  
- **Ride Management**: 
  - Calculate fares based on distance and price per kilometer.
  - Complete rides and handle payment transactions.

- **Place and Route Management**: 
  - Find the shortest path between places by car.
  - Generate random road types and distances.

- **Payment Processing**: 
  - Process payments from riders and update account balances.

- **Review System**: 
  - Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for rides.

## Skills Learned

- **Data Structures**: Implemented and utilized graphs, priority queues, and unordered maps.
- **Algorithms**: Applied Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path computation.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Designed and implemented classes for Users, Rides, Payments, and Reviews.
- **C++ Programming**: Leveraged C++ features including classes, inheritance, and standard library functions.
